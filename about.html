            <p>Run-time linking greatly simplifies link options; everything happens at run time. Your code must load 
                    pythonNN.dll using the Windows LoadLibraryEx()routine. The code must also use access routines and data in pythonNN.dll (that is, Python’s C API’s)
                     using pointers obtained by the Windows GetProcAddress() routine. Macros can make using these pointers transparent to any C code that 
                 calls routines in Python’s C API.</p><br></p>
